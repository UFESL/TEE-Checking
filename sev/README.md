# AMD SEV: Formal Model and Property Verification

This directory contains a formal model of **AMD SEV** (Secure Encrypted Virtualization), a VM-based **Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)** that provides **memory confidentiality and integrity** for guest virtual machines by encrypting guest memory and protecting CPU state transitions.

## üîí What is AMD SEV?

**AMD SEV** protects VMs from a potentially malicious hypervisor by encrypting memory with keys unique to each VM. SEV is built into AMD CPUs and secures data in-use, especially during cloud-based execution.

### Extensions to SEV:

- **SEV-ES**: Adds register state encryption on **VMEXIT**, preventing the hypervisor from snooping on CPU state.
- **SEV-SNP**: Adds advanced memory integrity, including Reverse Map Table (RMP), **Secure Nested Paging**, and **Page Validation (PVALIDATE)**.
- **SEV-TIO**: I/O protection layer (not modeled here as it doesn't affect guest lifecycle or memory state directly).

We **focus on SEV, SEV-ES, and SEV-SNP**, excluding SEV-TIO.

## üì¶ What We Model

We formally model **guest lifecycle**, **security metadata**, and **secure API (ABI)** behavior. The model includes symbolic execution-based checking of **confidentiality** and **integrity** properties using [Rosette](https://emina.github.io/rosette/), a symbolic execution framework for Racket.

|------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

To run the property checks:
```bash
racket confidentility.rkt   ;; for CP1‚ÄìCP7
racket integrity.rkt        ;; for IP1‚ÄìIP5 
```

### üñ•Ô∏è Output Description

Upon running, you‚Äôll see property-specific printouts like:

```
[CP 1] Only the assigned guest may access the page (via RMP check)
‚úÖ PASS: No unauthorized guest can access the page.

[CP 4] Page access requires validation
‚ùå FAIL: Unvalidated page was accessible!
Counterexample: guest-id = 1, page-addr = 0x1000
```

This indicates whether symbolic evaluation found a **counterexample**, i.e., a violation of the property.

## üê≥ Docker Setup and How to Run

To run this in a containerized setup:

### 1. Build Docker Image (from `util/docker/Dockerfile`)
```bash
docker build -t rosset:1.0.0 -f util/docker/Dockerfile .
```

### 2. Run Container with Model Mounted:
```bash
docker run --volume=/path_to_model:/formal -it rosset:1.0.0
```

Inside the container:
```bash
cd /formal/sev/src
racket test.rkt
racket confidentility.rkt

## üìé Final Notes

- This work assumes the platform firmware (e.g., AMD-SP) behaves correctly and is out of scope.
- The focus is exclusively on **guest-level behavior modeling**, especially lifecycle and state handling.
