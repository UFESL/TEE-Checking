# Intel TDX: Formal Model and Property Verification

This directory contains a formal model of **Intel TDX** (Trust Domain Extensions), a VM-based **Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)** that ensures **memory confidentiality and integrity** for virtual machines by isolating guest VMs from the hypervisor using encryption, access control, and hardware support.

## üîí What is Intel TDX?

**Intel TDX** provides hardware-isolated **Trust Domains (TDs)** within a system, protecting them from a potentially malicious hypervisor. TDX leverages **Multi-Key Total Memory Encryption (MKTME)** and secure VM lifecycle management to ensure strong **confidentiality** and **integrity** guarantees.

### Key Features of Intel TDX:

- **SEAM mode**: A secure VMX root operation mode that enables TDX-specific instructions and modules.
- **HKID-tagged encryption**: Memory is encrypted using hardware keys unique to each TD.
- **TD Owner Bit**: Ensures access to TD memory only from authorized SEAM contexts.
- **Secure VM Lifecycle**: Controlled creation, configuration, blocking, and teardown of TDs.

## üì¶ What We Model

We formally model the **TD lifecycle**, **cache mechanisms**, **TDX-specific data structures**, and **ABI behaviors** using [Rosette](https://emina.github.io/rosette/) to check **confidentiality** and **integrity** through symbolic execution.

## üß™ Test Cases and Execution

All properties and ABIs are tested through Rosette‚Äôs symbolic engine. The symbolic evaluation uses both **HKID-tagged cache** and **TD-owner-bit cache** implementations.

To run tests:
```bash
racket test.rkt
```

## üìé Final Notes

- This work models the **TD lifecycle**, **secure memory access**, and **cache protections** under Intel TDX.
- The **platform firmware (e.g., SEAM loader)** is assumed trusted and out of scope.
- Emphasis is on **verifying confidentiality and integrity** in the presence of a compromised hypervisor.
