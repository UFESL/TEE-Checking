Intel(R) Advisor can now assist with vectorization and show optimization
  report messages with your source code.
See "https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-advisor-xe" for details.


Begin optimization report for: n0_aes_DecKeyExpansion_NI(Ipp8u *, const Ipp8u *, int)

    Report from: Vector optimizations [vec]

   remark #15344: loop was not vectorized: vector dependence prevents vectorization. First dependence is shown below. Use level 5 report for details
   remark #15346: vector dependence: assumed ANTI dependence between encKeys[nr] (45:23) and decKeys[nr] (45:23)
