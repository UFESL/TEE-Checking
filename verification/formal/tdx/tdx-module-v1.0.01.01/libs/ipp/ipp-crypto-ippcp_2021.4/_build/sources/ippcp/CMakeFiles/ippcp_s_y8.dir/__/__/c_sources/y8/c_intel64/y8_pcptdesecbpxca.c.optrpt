Intel(R) Advisor can now assist with vectorization and show optimization
  report messages with your source code.
See "https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-advisor-xe" for details.


Begin optimization report for: ECB_TDES(const Ipp64u *, Ipp64u *, int, const RoundKeyDES **, const Ipp32u *)

    Report from: Vector optimizations [vec]
