Intel(R) Advisor can now assist with vectorization and show optimization
  report messages with your source code.
See "https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-advisor-xe" for details.


Begin optimization report for: n0_gs_inv(BNU_CHUNK_T *, const BNU_CHUNK_T *, gsModEngine *, alm_inv)

    Report from: Vector optimizations [vec]
