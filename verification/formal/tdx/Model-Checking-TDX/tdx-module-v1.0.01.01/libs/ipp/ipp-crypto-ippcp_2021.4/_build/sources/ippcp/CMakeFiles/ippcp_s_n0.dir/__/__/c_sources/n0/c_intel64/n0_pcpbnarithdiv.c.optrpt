Intel(R) Advisor can now assist with vectorization and show optimization
  report messages with your source code.
See "https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-advisor-xe" for details.


Begin optimization report for: n0_ippsDiv_BN(IppsBigNumState *, IppsBigNumState *, IppsBigNumState *, IppsBigNumState *)

    Report from: Vector optimizations [vec]
