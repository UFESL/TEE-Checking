Intel(R) Advisor can now assist with vectorization and show optimization
  report messages with your source code.
See "https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-advisor-xe" for details.


Begin optimization report for: k0_ippsGFpECESEncrypt_SM2(const Ipp8u *, Ipp8u *, int, IppsECESState_SM2 *)

    Report from: Vector optimizations [vec]

   remark #15344: loop was not vectorized: vector dependence prevents vectorization. First dependence is shown below. Use level 5 report for details
   remark #15346: vector dependence: assumed ANTI dependence between pState->kdfIndex (58:4) and pOutput[i] (60:10)
