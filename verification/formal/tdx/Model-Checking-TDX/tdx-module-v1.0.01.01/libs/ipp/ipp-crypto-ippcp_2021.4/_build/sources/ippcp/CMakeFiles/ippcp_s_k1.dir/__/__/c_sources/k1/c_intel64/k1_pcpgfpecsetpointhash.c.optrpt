Intel(R) Advisor can now assist with vectorization and show optimization
  report messages with your source code.
See "https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-advisor-xe" for details.


Begin optimization report for: k1_ippsGFpECSetPointHash(Ipp32u, const Ipp8u *, int, IppsGFpECPoint *, IppsGFpECState *, IppHashAlgId, Ipp8u *)
