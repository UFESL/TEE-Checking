Intel(R) Advisor can now assist with vectorization and show optimization
  report messages with your source code.
See "https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-advisor-xe" for details.


Begin optimization report for: sha1_hashOctString(Ipp8u *, void *)

    Report from: Vector optimizations [vec]

   remark #15344: loop was not vectorized: vector dependence prevents vectorization. First dependence is shown below. Use level 5 report for details
   remark #15346: vector dependence: assumed FLOW dependence between pMD[_2] (69:14) and pHashVal[_2] (69:14)
