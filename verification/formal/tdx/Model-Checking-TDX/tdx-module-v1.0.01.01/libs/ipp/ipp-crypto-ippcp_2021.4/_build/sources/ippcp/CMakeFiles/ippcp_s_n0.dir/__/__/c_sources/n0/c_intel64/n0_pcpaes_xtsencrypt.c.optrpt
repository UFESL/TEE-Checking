Intel(R) Advisor can now assist with vectorization and show optimization
  report messages with your source code.
See "https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-advisor-xe" for details.


Begin optimization report for: n0_ippsAES_XTSEncrypt(const Ipp8u *, Ipp8u *, int, const IppsAES_XTSSpec *, const Ipp8u *, int)
